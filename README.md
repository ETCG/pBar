License: Please see the LICENSE file for the license.

This is programmed in c++, and is all original code.
All you need is the class called pBar. An example of how to use it is included in the source file.
Other than that, if you know c++ this is pretty straight forward. Feel free to modify and distribute as you will, as long as you follow the license.

Note about operation: If you are to use this, run `print();` far more often than I do in the demo. It will look a lot more natural. You will have to see what you like best, and what works best with your code. I made pBar with flexibility in mind, so enjoy!

Note: I built this progress bar from the ground up, but used the same default feel of the progress bar I made in PassGen (https://github.com/ETCG/PassGen).
